### Case 3
#### ELECTRON BEAM WELDING PROCESS
The results of experimental studies carried out in order to improve the technological process of electron-beam welding of a product, the assembly of which consists of elements consisting of dissimilar material, were taken as initial data. The installation of electron beam welding, on which the research was carried out, is designed for electron beam welding in high vacuum of parts of assembly units made of stainless steels, titanium, aluminum and special alloys. The existing installation of electron-beam welding ensures the repeatability of modes within the capabilities of the implemented control system. Welding works were performed on imitating samples corresponding to the technological product. To reduce the energy input when welding:
1. Decreased welding current (IW);
2. The focusing current of the electron beam (IF) was increased;
3. Increased welding speed (VW);
4. The distance from the surface of the samples to the electron-optical system (FP) changed.
According to the set of parameters of technological regimes, the minimum possible dimensions of welds were provided: the depth of the weld (Depth) and the width of the weld (Width).
In the process of performing the work, electron-beam welding of 18 units of samples was carried out. The results of metallographic control of the dimensions of the weld for each sample were carried out in 4 cross sections of the weld. The accelerating voltage was constant in the range of 19.8â€“20 kV. The set of obtained data is collected as part of the welding modes, the dimensions of the welds in the cross sections of all samples.

### Prediction
Based on the set of parameters of technological regimes, predict dimensions of welds: weld depth (Depth) and weld width (Width).
